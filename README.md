 ### Guiding question :
 Does the relative/Absolute distance between parking garages have an impact on the individual price of these garages?
 
 #### Required Data:
 
 AreaID : Identifying code of a parking area or facility.
 
 AreaManagerID : Identifying code of an owner/manager or parking-facilitator
 
 AreaDesc : Name of area
 
 UsageID : Description of the area.
 
 Location : Location in Longitude/Latitude
 
 FareCalculationCode : Code of a certain price calculation
 
 FareCalculationDesc : The description of a certain price calculation

### Verwachting: 



My expectations are that areas that contain a high amount of parking garages, will have more competitive prices, while areas with few parking garages will try to monopolize on that fact.

I also expect densely populated areas to have higher prizes due to the high demand for parking spots.
